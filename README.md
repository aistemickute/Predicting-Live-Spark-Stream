The main aim of this assignment was to build a model using Apache spark MLlib which could predict labels (“safe”, “unsafe” and “vandal”) for the incoming Wikipedia edits stream. 

The file "Project review" gives an overview of the main steps taken in order to achieve the goal in addition to the final results. It also displays some parts of the code. 

The files spark_streaming_save.ipynb, spark_streaming_model.ipynb, spark_streaming_predicting_real_time.ipynb contain code for saving some of the Spark stream data for model creation, data pre-processing and model creation, and predicting Spark stream in real-time, respectively.
